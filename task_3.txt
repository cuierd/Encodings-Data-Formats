XML:
Advantage: Well structured, easily readable for human, friendly for python to work with, easy to share among people,
Can store meta information. Document-oriented.
Disadvantage: Tedious to work with. Cost quite some memories. Slow to parse. Difficult to generate(at least for me).

Json:
Advantage: Easier and faster to parse. Cost less memories.
Disadvantage: Less secure. Less readable ofr human beings.

CSV:
Advantage: Very easy to read for human beings. Easy to generate and to import.
Disadvantage: Not good at handling metadata.

Feedback:
About 4 hours.
If count the time we went through the lectures and tutorials, it can mount to 10 hours.
In general, the exercise is not difficult.
We spend some extra time because we were trapped by a (stupid) mistake in task 1.1.
Certainly. It helps a lot.
